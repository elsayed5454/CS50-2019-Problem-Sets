            Arabic calligraphy is one of the fantastic and oldest arts.
        </p>
        <p>
           Five principal Arabic calligraphic cursive styles:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Naskh</li>
            <li>Nasta‘liq</li>
            <li>Diwani</li>
            <li>Thuluth</li>
            <li>Reqa</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We'll talk about one of them which is:

        <p>
            The use of cursive scripts coexisted with Kufic, and historically cursive was commonly used for informal purposes.
            With the rise of Islam, a new script was needed to fit the pace of conversions, and a well-defined cursive called naskh first appeared in the 10th century.
            Naskh translates to "copying," as it became the standard for transcribing books and manuscripts.
            The script is the most ubiquitous among other styles, used in the Qur'an, official decrees, and private correspondence.
            It became the basis of modern Arabic print.
        </p>
        <p>
            Standardization of the style was pioneered by Ibn Muqla (886 – 940 A.D.) and later expanded by Abu Hayan at-Tawhidi (died 1009 A.D.).
            Ibn Muqla is highly regarded in Muslim sources on calligraphy as the inventor of the naskh style, although this seems to be erroneous.
            Since Ibn Muqla wrote with a distinctly rounded hand, many scholars drew the conclusion that he founded this script.
            Ibn al-Bawwab, the student of Ibn Muqla, is actually believed to have created this script.
            However, Ibn Muqla did establish systematic rules and proportions for shaping the letters, which use 'alif as the x-height.
