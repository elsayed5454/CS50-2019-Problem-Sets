            Alexandria is the second-largest city in Egypt and a major economic centre.
        </p>
        <p>
           Alexandria is a Mediterranean port city in Egypt.
           During the Hellenistic period, it was home to a lighthouse ranking among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World as well as a storied library.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today the library is reincarnated in the disc-shaped, ultramodern Bibliotheca Alexandrina.
            The city also has Greco-Roman landmarks, old-world cafes and sandy beaches. Its 15th-century seafront Qaitbay Citadel is now a museum.

            We really love our city.
